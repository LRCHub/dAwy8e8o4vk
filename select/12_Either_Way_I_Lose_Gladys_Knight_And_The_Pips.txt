(Either way I lose)
(Either way I lose)

If I stay, I know that I must share your love
And that I couldn't take
And if I go, we'll be apart
And I know my heart would surely break
So, what difference does it make
Which one I choose

Either way I lose
(Either way I lose)
(Either way I lose)

Though I know, my love is true
And I'd die if you ever told me "goodbye"
(If you say "goodbye")
Still I know, she loves you too
She would do, the very same as I
So, what difference does it make
Which one you choose

Either way I lose
(Either way I lose)
(EIther way I lose)

So, what difference does it make
Which one you choose

Either way I lose
(Either way I lose)
EIther way I lose
(Either way I lose)
Either way I lose
(Either way I lose)
Either way I lose
(Either way I lose)
Either way I lose

[00:02.95] The world is moving in a circle
[00:06.16] Around the sun
[00:08.51] Before me and after me
[00:12.99] With me and without me
[00:16.37] I am not the world
[00:18.70] Or the sun
[00:20.36] I am moving nowhere with you
[00:23.01] And never without you
[00:25.33] You are always a pain
[00:27.62] And a yearning
[00:29.33] Threatening to ruin me either way

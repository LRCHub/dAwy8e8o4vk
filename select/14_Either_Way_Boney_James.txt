Never felt this way
Like I am paralyzed
But I can't stay like this forever
You're pulling on my heart strings
Any way you want
Are we in or
Are we out altogether?

You need to tell me either way (say you will)
Can no longer be afraid (say you won't)
Need to say it either way (how you feel)
Gotta tell me if you will or you won't
Will you stay?

We have so many options babe
We both could entertain
But I only have eyes for you
I feel some apprehension
When it's the same you claim
We just need to get to the truth

You need to tell me either way (say you will)
Can no longer be afraid (say you won't)
Need to say it either way (how you feel)
Gotta tell me if you will or you won't
Will you stay?

Cause you need to tell me either way (say you will)
Can no longer be afraid (say you won't)
No No No No
Need to say it either way
Gotta tell me if you will or you won't
Will you stay?

Tell me
(Tell me if you will)
(Say you will)
(Tell me if you won't)
What you want
(Tell me how you feel)
(Say you won't)
(This way can't go on)
Say you will
Say you won't
Either way I need to know
(Tell me if you will)
(How you feel)
(Tell me if you won't)
Why don't you tell me
(Tell me how i should feel)
I need to know it
(And what you want)
(This way can't go on)

Dontcha think I need to know
Dontcha think I need to know
Need to know
Need to know
Dontcha think I need to know Lady
Ooh ooh I really need to know

Got me hanging on a string
Ah baby
Someone here could fall and sprain
Yeah baby

(Tell me if you will)
(Tell me if you won't)
